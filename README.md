# Hotel Reservation System - SQL Analysis

## Project Description
This project focuses on performing SQL analysis on a *Hotel Reservation System*. The aim is to manage and analyze data efficiently by uploading a dataset, using SQL queries, and generating insightful reports.

## Dataset
- Uploaded a hotel reservation dataset into the SQL environment.
- The dataset includes tables such as:
  - booking_large
  - reservations_large
  - customers_large
  - hotels_large
  - rooms_large
  - 

These tables were pre-defined in the dataset and used directly for analysis.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Dataset Upload
- Uploaded the dataset into the SQL database using import tools.
- Verified the structure and relationships between tables.

### 2. SQL Analysis

#### a. Join Operations
- Used INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.

#### b. Aggregate Functions
- Applied SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MAX(), and MIN() to analyze financial and reservation data.

#### c. GROUP BY and HAVING
- Grouped results by fields like room type, customer ID, and payment status.
- Filtered grouped data using HAVING for conditions on aggregates.

#### d. Subqueries
- Used subqueries inside SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses to refine data output.

#### e. Views
- Created SQL views to simplify complex queries and to present summarized data:
  - Example: ReservationSummaryView, RevenueByRoomTypeView

## Output
- Query results and summaries were exported to PDF format.
- Dataset and output files were uploaded as supportingÂ documents.
